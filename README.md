The home page is the first impression visitors will have of your portfolio. Customize the content of the `index.html` file to provide a brief introduction and highlight your main achievements.

### About Section

The about section is where you can share more details about yourself, your interests, and your journey. Update the content in the `about.html` file to reflect your unique personality and background.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the styling, layout, and content of the website to match your personal brand. The `css` folder contains stylesheets that you can modify, and the `images` folder is where you can replace or add images.

Happy coding!
